to scrobble I use https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pScrobbler
I scrobble to https://libre.fm/
I pull info from libre.fm with a script that a very nice cat named flunky wrote; it's called flunky.sh because I'm very, vey, imaginative. The script is listed here, too.
Not bothering to list non-open tools; I listen mostly on my phone running a non-free OS with a non-free music app. No LineageOS for my phone and I haven't found a f/loss music app that meets all my needs :(
