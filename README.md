# playlists

An attempt to track my playlist changes AND learn a bit about using git

playlist: I have one main playlist that I use for daily listening: it consists of albums released mainly\* in the last two years. I play it on random. The purpose of it is to avoid nostalgia and to find new music.

\* exempted is classical, traditional, jazz.

git: fucked if I know what I'm doing with git. I don't code, but I think I can see a use for it for managing changing things like music playlists. I use git currently like a repo of software I wanna play with. clone foo, then build it. I'd like to learn more about using git than that. Especially about making changes locally and ....erm....?syncing? ?uploading? them to github. 
I unno if this readme is beingused properly, but I like jumping in so here I be.
